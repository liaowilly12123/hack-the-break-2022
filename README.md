# hack-the-break-2022
## Inspiration:
With the purpose of learning while playing, we want to help review their knowledge before taking the test. This app will help students' brains easier to remember the knowledge efficiently and it's so much fun instead of just reading the book. 

## What it does
This app helps CST students to review questions. Users can select the topic that they are interested in to start from.

## How we built it
We used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to build the app, and this is a mobile-first app.

## Challenges we ran into
We met a lot of challenges during the development. For example, we had to overcome the fatigue to develop the app in 24 hours. Also, combining all the individual works together is a tough part. We had to figure out how to adapt everyone’s work to the main skeleton because combining the CSS and HTML files can be tricky sometimes.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of:
We are proud of our success to build an application and it works in a fleeting time and we collaborate to work together.

## What we learned:
We have learned many things during the Hackathon such as coming up with an idea as a team, working together as a team, dividing the jobs amongst ourselves, and learning how to come up with solutions to problems we’ve never come across.

## What's next for DebugRun
We are hoping to add more subjects and perhaps a level of difficulty based on chapters. We also thought about adding a leaderboard so classmates can go against each other.
